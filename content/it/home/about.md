Hi! I am **Stefano Grasso**, since July 2022 I work as a Multiplexed Synthetic Biology Scientist in the newly established Biofoundry of ([Lesaffre](http://www.lesaffre.com/)) in Lille (France). 

Until May 2022, I was Post-doc at the Centro de Biotecnología y Genómica de Plantas ([CBGP](http://www.cbgp.upm.es/)) within the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid ([UPM](https://www.upm.es/)). From 2015 to 2020 I was a Marie Curie fellow within the ITN project [ProteinFactory](http://proteinfactory-msca-itn.eu/), and a PhD student at UMCG (Groninen University, NL) and DSM Food Specialties B.V. (Delft, NL). 

I obtained my MSc in Plant and Animal Biotechnology in 2015 at University of Udine and my BSc in Biotechnology in 2013 at the same University. In parallel to University, I was also a student of [Scuola Superiore dell'Università degli Studi di Udine](https://scuolasuperiore.uniud.it/) an institute of excellence for highly talented students. Students at the Scuola Superiore had to obtain an outstanding GPA (at least an average of 90%), follow extra courses and produce two small theses per year. Additionally the School was providing a full board and lodging scholarship. 

During University, I have also been an elected member of the Faculty council and later I had a full mandate as elected student member of the Academic Senate (University Council). I have also represented the Scuola Superiore within the network of Italian Excellence Institutes contributing to the formation of the actual Association comprising all students of such institutes.

In my free time I like to travel and to cook. When cooking I apply the same principles I use in the lab, thus I claim I am a scientific cooker (my best dishes ranges from Carbonara, to Pizza, to molecular cockatails).
