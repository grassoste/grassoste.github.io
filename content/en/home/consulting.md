I offer tailoerd solution for any necessity in the broader field of biotechnology and bioinformatics (both wet- and dry-lab).
Due to my hybrid experience I can assist you in the wet-lab part, always taking into account all the other aspects. Similarly, I can provide advice and support for _in silico_ projects by always having in mind the experimental counterpart.
