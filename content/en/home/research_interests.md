I have very broad research interestes all pointing into the direction of fusing (bio)informatics and (bio)technology, in what is at the moment called Synthetic biology. Main interests are in (but not limited to): protein secretion, strain development and optimization, protein analyses and annotation, genomic annotation, comparative proteomic and genomic analyses, development of prediction tools, synthetic biology and genetic engineering.

I also have a very broad thecnical and scientifc knowledge and experience. While I am mostly expert in moelecular biology and molecular genetics, I have extensive experience also in proteomics and bioinformatics, in species spanning from bacteria to plants. Additioanlly, because I always had a keen interest in computer and machineries, I can easily work on the hardware side of a problem, other than the software and conceputal/sceintific sides. I am in fact interested also in automation and open hardware.

Overall I am complete scientist, able to lead and manage projects from their drafting, design, customization, implementation, execution, analysis, and dissemination of the results.
